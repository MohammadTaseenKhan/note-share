A triangle is a three-sided polygon, which has three vertices. The three sides are connected with each other end to end at a point, which forms the angles of the triangle. The sum of all three angles of the triangle is equal to 180 degrees.

﻿## What are triangles

A triangle is **a three-sided polygon, which has three vertices**. The three sides are connected with each other end to end at a point, which forms the angles of the triangle. The sum of all three angles of the triangle is equal to 180 degrees.


## A triangle is a type of polygon

A triangle is a type of polygon, which has three sides, and the two sides are joined end to end is called the vertex of the triangle. An angle is formed between two sides. This is one of the important parts of geometry.

Some major concepts, such as Pythagoras theorem and trigonometry, are dependent on triangle properties. A triangle has different types based on its angles and sides.

## Shape of Triangle

Triangle is a closed two-dimensional shape. It is a three-sided polygon. All sides are made of straight lines. The point where two straight lines join is the vertex. Hence, the triangle has three vertices. Each vertex forms an angle

## Angles of Triangle

There are three angles in a triangle. These angles are formed by two sides of the triangle, which meets at a common point, known as the vertex. The sum of all three interior angles is equal to 180 degrees.

If we extend the side length outwards, then it forms an exterior angle. The sum of consecutive interior and exterior angles of a triangle is supplementary.

## Properties

1.  A triangle has three sides and three angles.
2.  The sum of the angles of a triangle is always  **180 degrees**.
3.  The exterior angles of a triangle always add up to  **360 degrees**.
4.  The sum of consecutive interior and exterior angle is supplementary.
5.  The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side. Similarly, the difference between the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than the length of the third side.
6.  The shortest side is always opposite the smallest interior angle. Similarly, the longest side is always opposite the largest interior angle.


## Types

On the basis of length of the sides, triangles are classified into three categories:

1.  Scalene Triangle
2.  Isosceles Triangle
3.  Equilateral Triangle

On the basis of measurement of the angles, triangles are classified into three categories:

1.  Acute Angle Triangle
2.  Right Angle Triangle
3.  Obtuse Angle Triangle

## Perimeter of Triangle

A perimeter of a triangle is defined as the total length of the outer boundary of the triangle. Or we can say, the perimeter of the triangle is equal to the sum of all its three sides. The unit of the perimeter is same as the unit of sides of the triangle.

Perimeter = Sum of All Sides

### What is the formula for area and perimeter of a triangle?

The perimeter of triangle = Sum of all three sides  
Area = ½ (Product of base and height of a triangle)

### What is scalene, isosceles and equilateral triangle?

Scalene, isosceles and equilateral triangle are the types of triangles which differ from each other based on their side-length.  
If all the three sides are different in length, then its scalene triangle.  
If any two sides are equal in length, then it is an isosceles triangle.  
If all three sides are equal in length, then it is an equilateral triangle.

### What is the difference between acute triangle, obtuse triangle and right triangle?

An acute triangle has all its angles less than 90 degrees.  
An obtuse triangle has any one of its angle greater than 90 degrees.  
A right triangle has exactly one angle equal to 90 degrees.
